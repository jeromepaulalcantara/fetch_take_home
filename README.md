First: explore the data

Review the unstructured csv files and answer the following questions with code that supports your conclusions:

Are there any data quality issues present?

Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?



The following files should provide answers to the questions above:

First part - Answers with explanation.pdf      (includes a detailed answer with references both to the jupyter notebook file and sql file)

First part - Data Examination through python.ipynb    (jupyter notebook file that includes python pandas script for data quality check and python seaborn and pyplot for visualization)

First part - Additional Data Examination in SQL.sql    (sql file created from SQL Server that serves as additional data checks)



Second: provide SQL queries

Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.

Closed-ended questions:

What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?

What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?

What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?

Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.

Who are Fetch’s power users?

Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?

At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?



The following files should provide answers to the questions above:

Second part - Closed-ended questions.sql      (SQL file created from SQL Server that contains queries to answer the three closed-ended questions)

Second part - Open-ended questions.sql        (SQL file created from SQL Server that contains queries to answer the three OPEN-ended questions)



Third: communicate with stakeholders

Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:

Key data quality issues and outstanding questions about the data

One interesting trend in the data

Use a finding from part 2 or come up with a new insight

Request for action: explain what additional help, info, etc. you need to make sense of the data and resolve any outstanding issues



The following files should provide answers to the questions above:

Data Quality Review – Key Findings & Next Steps.msg      (This email contains the questions and clarifications to be sent to the business stakeholder)
